# cantus firmus

this is a simple tool that allows you to arrange monophonic melodies and enables you to send them over MIDI to other programs.

## how to use

the display is a standard treble clef, but to conserve on space, octaves are remapped over the same lines.

click on a note to edit it. the keyboard up and down keys can be used to adjust pitch.

you can also navigate between notes by using the tab key (to go to the next note) or shift-tab (to go to the previous note)

## caveats

this tool uses the [Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) which is not supported on all browsers. works best and tested in Chrome 88.
